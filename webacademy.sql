"Do you want to become a programmer? Do you want to learn how to create games, automate your browser, visualize data, and much more?
If youâ€™re looking to learn Python for the very first time or need a quick brush-up, this is the course for you!
Python has rapidly become one of the most popular programming languages around the world. Compared to other languages such as Java or C++, Python consistently outranks and outperforms these languages in demand from businesses and job availability. 
The average Python developer makes over $100,000 - this number is only going to grow in the coming years.
The best part? Python is one of the easiest coding languages to learn right now. It doesnâ€™t matter if you have no programming experience or are unfamiliar with the syntax of Python. 
By the time you finish this course, you'll be an absolute pro at programming!
This course will cover all the basics and several advanced concepts of Python. Weâ€™ll go over:
- The fundamentals of Python programming
- Writing and Reading to Files
- Automation of Word and Excel Files
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup4
- Browser automation with Selenium
- Data Analysis and Visualization with MatPlotLib
- Regex parsing and Task Management
- GUI and Gaming with Tkinter
- And much more!
If you read the above list and are feeling a bit confused, donâ€™t worry! As an instructor and student on Udemy for almost 4 years, I know what itâ€™s like to be overwhelmed with boring and mundane.
 I promise youâ€™ll have a blast learning the ins and outs of python. Iâ€™ve successfully taught over 200,000+ students from over 200 countries jumpstart their programming journeys through my courses. ",

"Youâ€™ve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth Java programming course online. With close to 600,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and forty thousand reviews (with tens of thousands of those 5-star) to date, 
these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything youâ€™ll ever need.Whether you want to:
- build the skills you need to get your first Java programming job
- move to a more senior software developer position
- pass the oracle java certification exam
- or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps quickly.
...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this, and more.
N.B. Java 17 support coming soon, read on below...
Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want and which course will give you those skills?
This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.  By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer.
Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.
Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.  
She didn't even complete the course! 'Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.   I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift,
 and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) 
 a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing. With gratitude,  Laura'
The course is a whopping 80 hours long.  Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?
Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.
Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.
The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.
For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.
If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.
Why would you choose to learn Java?
The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language?
The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is either #1 or in the top 3.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.
The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today.
What version of Java should you learn?
Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but that's not the case with Java.
Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.  Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support.  Other versions have long-term support, for many years.
You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.
A company using Java technology (big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.  They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.
Right now, in July 21 the version of Java that offers this long-term support (LTS) is Java 11 - It's being fully supported until at least 2025 and likely will be extended from there.
As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's Java 11.
The next LTS version of Java is Java 17, scheduled for release in September 2021.   The course will be updated, and the updates made available to you free once Java 17 is live.  The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.
BOTTOM LINE: You will learn the RIGHT VERSION of JAVA in this course!  Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers. ", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVOhOGBYHo0",

"Have you ever wanted to create a Web application but didn't know where to start? Have you previously tried to learn Django but got fed up with incomplete YouTube videos and poorly written tutorials? Or are you looking to move your code from Django 2 to Django 3?
THEN THIS IS THE COURSE FOR YOU!
In my Django course, I will walk you through the Django web framework from beginning to end! I'm a self-taught programmer so I know what it feels like to start from scratch. I care about your learning, but even more importantly... I care about you!
What is Django?
Django is an open-source web framework that is written in Python. It was created about twelve years ago, but new in 2020 we have Django 3 with a whole new set of features and capabilities!
Django is an amazing framework for web developers because it provides the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact forms, file uploads, and more. 
Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework and utilize these components that are already built, and focus your time on developing your web app instead.
If you're going to be working with Python, especially for web applications or web design, you'll want to learn the Django framework. It will save you a ton of time!
Contents and Overview
I believe we learn best by doing. So, throughout this course you'll be presented with coding quizzes and challenges in order for you to test what you just learned. This format will allow you to actually learn Django and not just follow along like a robot ;)
We will use Python in this course, so if you have never used Python before, we will start with a python refresher to get you up to speed (no other python experience required).
We will then dive into making three complete websites:

1 - Password Generator: A simple website to create a random password with several options. 
- You will learn how to:
- Install Django
- Create a new project
- Work with Django's URL routing
- Creating Templates
- Submit and handle HTML form data

2 - Personal Portfolio: Create your own portfolio to show to potential employers showing off your resume, previous projects, and a fully functional blog. You will learn how to:
- Add apps to your project
- Work with models and databases (including SQLite)
- Access the admin panel
- Create super users
- Make a responsive website with Bootstrap 4
- Work with static and media files
- Extending Templates
- Formating dates and purals

3 - Todo Woo: A website where a user can sign up for an account, and fully manage a todo list with the ability to create, edit, and delete. You will learn how to:
- Work with the authentication system (sign up, login, logout)
- Create virtual environments
- Establish model relationships
- Require login for certain pages
- Create a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Queries and filters
- Handling Errors

I will also walk you through Git, which is an awesome tool for developers that allows you to create multiple versions of your code. I'll explain why this is useful and help you understand why you should use it.
Additionally, I will show you how to take the projects that you made in this course and publish them live on the web through Python Anywhere. Like I said, I will take you from the very beginning to the very end!
Course material is regularly refreshed to include all of the newest updates and information. Additionally, I have made this course downloadable, so you can work through the class offline, making it as convenient as possible for you! 
Most instructors won't allow this, but I want you to be able to enjoy this course in whichever way is best for you :)

"JavaScript is THE most important programming language you need to learn as a web developer - and with this course, you make sure that you will not miss a single thing you have to know as a JavaScript developer!
This is the most comprehensive and modern course you can find on JavaScript - it's based on all my JavaScript knowledge AND teaching experience. 
It's both a complete guide, starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an extensive reference of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course!
It's a huge course because it's packed with important knowledge and helpful content. From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. 
My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics.
The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with more than 1,500,000 students on WebAcademy as well as on my YouTube channel CoderLipi. 
It's packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript.

What's in the course?
This course is obviously packed with content - I therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:
- Modern JavaScript from the start: The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the latest syntax from the start (you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY JS project)
- ALL the Basics: Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc
- Arrays & Objects: We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail
- Control Structures: Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops
- A look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us
- Deep dives into Core Concepts: ALL the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes
- Working with the DOM: How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)
- Events in JavaScript: Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag & drop) and execute appropriate code
- Classes & Object-oriented Programming: Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the 'this' keyword, constructor functions and much more
- Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming: We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/ await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly
- Http Requests: Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript
- Tooling, Optimizations & Browser Support: Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers  - this matters and hence is covered in great detail
- Libraries & Frameworks: Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like React.js - why they matter and how to use them
- Node.js: Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment
- Security & Performance Optimizations: Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!
- Automated Testing: Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing",

"Congratulations!  You've found the most popular, most complete, and most up-to-date resource online for learning React!
Thousands of other engineers have learned React, and you can too.  This course uses a time-tested, battle-proven method to make sure you understand exactly how React work, and will get you a new job working as a software engineer or help you build that app you've always been dreaming about.
The difference between this course and all the others: you will understand the design patterns used by top companies to build massively popular web apps.
React is the most popular Javascript library of the last five years, and the job market is still hotter than ever.  Companies large and small can't hire engineers who understand React fast enough, and salaries for engineers are at an all time high.  It's a great time to learn React!

----------------------

What will you build?
This course features hundreds of videos with dozens of custom diagrams to help you understand how React work.  No prior experience with either is necessary. 
Through tireless, patient explanations and many interesting practical examples, you'll learn the fundamentals of building dynamic and live web apps using React.
Each topic included in this course is added incrementally, to make sure that you have a solid foundation of knowledge.  You'll find plenty of discussion added in to help you understand exactly when and where to use each feature of React.
My guarantee to you: there is no other course online that teaches more features of React.  This is the most comprehensive resource there is.

Below is a partial list of the topics you'll find in this course:
Master the fundamental features of React, including JSX, state, and props
From square one, understand how to build reusable components
Dive into the source code of React to understand how it works behind the scenes
Test your knowledge and hone your skills with numerous coding exercises
Integrate React with advanced browser features, even geolocation API's!
Use popular styling libraries to build beautiful apps
Master different techniques of deployment so you can show off the apps you build!
See different methods of building UI's through composition of components

Besides just React, you'll pick up countless other tidbits of knowledge, including ES2015 syntax, popular design patterns, even the clearest explanation of the keyword 'this' in Javascript that you'll ever hear.
This is the course I wanted to take when I first learned React: complete, up-to-date, and clear.",
